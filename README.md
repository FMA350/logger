Video might have killed radio stars, but this radio inspired Logger class is here to stay.

You use your radio (a singleton class) to query a certain channel (the class that logs the message).
Each station can make use of multiple modulations.
Radio has AM and FM. This library has File modulation and standard-output modulations.
